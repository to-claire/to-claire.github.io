Reflecting on Dan Garcia et al.'s paper, "Achieving 'A's for All (as Time and Interest Allow)", brings me back to my own journey in computer science. Garcia’s concept of transforming education through mastery learning and a growth mindset mirrors my experiences and beliefs. His discussion for “fixed learning, variable time,” where each student is given the time needed to reach their fullest potential, profoundly resonates with me. Shifting away from rigid deadlines to flexible timelines conveys more than just a change in philosophy; it embodies a transformation in education that honors each student’s unique path of learning.

Early on, I struggled with C++, which I took as my second computer science course during the pandemic. Navigating college-level material in an isolating online environment while concurrently enrolled in high school was challenging. Although I earned an A, I felt my understanding was far from sufficient to move on to the next class in the sequence. I was overwhelmed, feeling like I was drowning; I tried to keep up with the class merely to accumulate enough points but felt too lost to grasp the material fully. I began to think that perhaps computer science wasn’t for me, so I took a year off to explore other fields.

This experience made me question the traditional grading system, which often treats grades as an endpoint rather than a true measure of understanding. Garcia’s criticism of this model, highlighting how it fails to account for individual learning paces, resonates deeply with me. His ideas of soft deadlines and the concept of incomplete or overridden grades, allowing students to revisit material until they reach true proficiency, would have been invaluable to me in those early courses. When I eventually returned to C++, I had the opportunity to re-engage with the material, support others, and develop a stronger foundation. Through teaching and explaining concepts to my peers and friends, I acquired a deeper understanding of the subject myself. I felt more confident in my abilities and began to believe that perhaps I could indeed pursue computer science. This experience taught me that with sufficient time, support, and resilience, mastery can not only emerge from struggle but also develop an appreciation for the learning process itself.

The concept of "A's for All" envisions an educational environment where students can work on a subject until they achieve true proficiency. This approach deeply resonates with me, especially for subjects that build on one another, like computer science. From my experience, a strong comprehension of the prerequisites is critical for embarking upon the next, and without that foundation, students can be left struggling in subsequent courses.

At the heart of Garcia's philosophy is that students should progress based on individual growth, rather than adhering to unforgiving and uncompromising timelines. In my case, the freedom to review material and go at my own pace would have made a world of difference. I’ve learned that the true value in education lies in the opportunity to learn deeply, struggle, and grow—not merely in earning grades.

Garcia's paper reflects a lesson from my personal academic journey: that persistence, growth, and a supportive community are far more valuable than a grade or a degree. I have learned to embrace every moment of the process—cherishing the memories, loving the challenges, and celebrating the little wins along the way. For in every challenge lies an opportunity to learn and grow, and looking back, I recognize that the experiences along the path often hold more meaning than the destination itself.
