Chocolate muffins and cupcakes are basically the same, aren't they? Except cupcakes have added frosting? This has been my most repeated recipes since it's so easy and satisfies my chocolate cravings! The bitterness is comparable to 90% dark chocolate to me, so I recommend you double the sugar if you prefer sweeter.

12 cupcakes, 130 cal per cupcake (5g sugar)

*I use 1/4 honey and cacao powder in this calculation, so sugar levels may vary on the sweetener and powder used.*

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients

-   1 cup all-purpose flour

-   1/2 cup cocoa or cacao powder (cacao is the healthier option)

-   1 teaspoon baking powder

-   1/2 teaspoon baking soda

-   1/2 teaspoon salt

### Wet Ingredients

-   1/2 cup whole milk

-   1/4 cup raw honey or pure maple syrup (1/2 cup for more sweetness)

-   1/4 cup olive oil

-   1 large egg

-   1/2 teaspoon vanilla

### Water

-   1/2 cup boiling bold expresso water

## Instructions

1.  Preheat oven to 325ยบ F.
2.  Add dry ingredients in a large bowl and whisk to combine well.
3.  Add wet ingredients (excluding expresso water) in another bowl and mix to combine well.
4.  Combine the dry and wet ingredients and mix well on medium speed.
5.  Reduce speed and add in boiling water.
6.  Beat on high speed for about 1 minute to add air into the batter.
7.  Fill cupcake liner \~1/2 full.
