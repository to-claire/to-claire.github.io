## About

Hello World! I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at UC Irvine. I am interested in studying theoretical computer science and researching in the field of computing education. My coursework follows the Algorithms and Intelligent Systems specialization tracks.

My MBTI is INTJ-T. I'm passionate about self-improvement, health, and nutrition. Outside of school, I enjoy pilates, dancing, baking healthy deserts, and reading books. I normally read fantasy romance novels, but lately I have been exploring more classic romances!

Currently, I am studying Machine Learning & Data Mining and Computational Geometry in my coursework. I am working as a reader/grader for Data Structures & Algorithms and undergrad researcher in the ICS department at UCI. On the side, I am practicing ballet and contemporary dance at OCC!
