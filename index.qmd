## About

Hello World! I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at UC Irvine. I am interested in studying theoretical computer science and researching in the field of computing education. My coursework follows the Algorithms and Intelligent Systems specialization tracks.

My Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is [INTJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality). I'm passionate about self-improvement, health, and nutrition. Outside of school, I enjoy pilates, dancing, baking healthy deserts, and reading. Lately, I have been exploring classic romance novels!

I love learning and believe we should strive to learn or experience something new each day, as a day without growth feels like a day wasted. In our fast-paced society, we often overlook the power of reading books, yet we learn invaluable lessons through stories—whether our own or others. Stories open our eyes to new perspectives and deepen our understanding of the world around us. There’s always more to discover and understand in life.

Currently, I am enjoying my coursework in Machine Learning & Data Mining and Computational Geometry. I am working as a reader/grader for Data Structures & Algorithms and as an undergraduate researcher in the Department of Computer Science at UCI. On the side, I practice ballet and contemporary dance at OCC!
