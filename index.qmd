## About

Hello World! I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at UC Irvine. I am interested in studying theoretical computer science and researching in the field of computing education. My coursework follows the Algorithms and Intelligent Systems specialization tracks.

My MBTI is [INTJ-T](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality). I'm passionate about self-improvement, health, and nutrition. Outside of school, I enjoy pilates, dancing, baking healthy deserts, and reading. Lately, I have been exploring classic romance novels!

I love learning. I believe we should always strive to learn or experience something new each day, as a day without growth is a day wasted. There's always more to discover and understand in life. 

Currently, I am studying Machine Learning & Data Mining and Computational Geometry in my coursework. I am working as a reader/grader for Data Structures & Algorithms and undergrad researcher in the Department of Computer Science at UCI. On the side, I am practicing ballet and contemporary dance at OCC!
