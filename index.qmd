## About

Hi! I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at UC Irvine. I am interested in studying theoretical computer science and researching in the field of computing education. My coursework follows the Algorithms and Intelligent Systems specialization tracks.

My MTBI is INTJ-T. I'm passionate about self-improvement, health, nutrition, and fitness. Outside of school, I enjoy pilates, dancing, baking healthy deserts, and reading books. I love fantasy romance novels and favorites are the Infernal Devices by Cassandra Clare.

Currently, I am exploring Machine Learning & Data Mining and Computational Geometry in my studies and working as a reader/grader for Data Structures & Algorithms and undergrad researcher in the ICS department at UCI. On the side, I am studying ballet and contemporary dance at OCC!
