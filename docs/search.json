    "section": "",
    "text": "Most ice creams, especially vanilla, are flavored with “natural flavors” which are not natural at all! It is nearly the same as artificial flavors, the only regulation being that it must be derived from any natural source. However, they may contain more than 100 different chemicals, including preservatives, solvents and other substances and still be called “natural flavors”. Not to mention all the added preservatives, gums, emulsifiers, and colorings in ice creams to increase the visual appeal, texture, and shelf life. I use vanilla extract in this recipe because vanilla beans are so expensive :( but if you have the means to use vanilla, I think it would work elegantly. You can also do a different flavoring or add in, ice cream is fun and flexible! Personally, my favorite combination is topping it off with olive oil and more salt. With these ingredients, I would even argue that ice cream can be a health food since full fat dairy products contain so many vitamins and minerals; honey is anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial; and eggs are arguably the most nutrient dense food ;)"

    "title": "The Journey of Learning: “A’s for All”",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dan Garcia et al.’s paper, “Achieving ’A’s for All (as Time and Interest Allow)”, brings me back to my own journey in computer science. His discussion for “fixed learning, variable time,” where each student is given the time needed to reach their fullest potential, encourages a growth mindset and profoundly resonates with me. Shifting away from rigid deadlines to flexible timelines conveys more than just a change in philosophy; it embodies a transformation in education that honors each student’s unique path of learning.\nEarly on, I struggled with C++, which I took as my second computer science course during the pandemic. Navigating college-level material in an isolating online environment while concurrently enrolled in high school was challenging. Although I earned an A, I felt my understanding was far from sufficient to move on to the next class in the sequence. I was overwhelmed, feeling like I was drowning; I tried to keep up with the class merely to accumulate enough points but felt too lost to grasp the material fully. I began to think that perhaps computer science wasn’t for me, so I took a year off to explore other fields.\nThis experience made me question the traditional grading system, which often treats grades as an endpoint rather than a true measure of understanding. Garcia’s criticism of this model, highlighting how it fails to account for individual learning paces, resonates deeply with me. His ideas of soft deadlines and the concept of incomplete or overridden grades, allowing students to revisit material until they reach true proficiency, would have been invaluable to me in those early courses.\nWhen I eventually returned to C++, I had the opportunity to re-engage with the material, support others, and develop a stronger foundation. Through teaching and explaining concepts to my peers and friends, I acquired a deeper understanding of the subject myself. I felt more confident in my abilities and began to believe that perhaps I could indeed pursue computer science. This experience taught me that with sufficient time, support, and resilience, mastery can not only emerge from struggle but also develop an appreciation for the learning process itself.\nThe concept of “A’s for All” envisions an educational environment where students can work on a subject until they achieve true proficiency. This approach deeply resonates with me, especially for subjects that build on one another, like computer science. From my experience, a strong comprehension of the prerequisites is critical for embarking upon the next, and without that foundation, students can be left struggling in subsequent courses.\nAt the heart of Garcia’s philosophy is that students should progress based on individual growth, rather than adhering to unforgiving and uncompromising timelines. In my case, the freedom to review material and go at my own pace would have made a world of difference. I’ve learned that the true value in education lies in the opportunity to learn deeply, struggle, and grow—not merely in earning grades.\nGarcia’s paper reflects a lesson from my personal academic journey: that persistence, growth, and a supportive community are far more valuable than a grade or a degree. I have learned to embrace every moment of the process—cherishing the memories, loving the challenges, and celebrating the little wins along the way. For in every challenge lies an opportunity to learn and grow, and looking back, I recognize that the experiences along the path often hold more meaning than the destination itself."

    "title": "The Best of Minds",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In I&CS 139W: Critical Writing on Information Technology, we were assigned an in-class prompt to write about the best of anything, so I wrote about minds.\nThe best of minds is a grateful one. What does it mean to have a grateful mindset? Throughout my interactions, I’ve noticed that those who cultivate a grateful mindset navigate life with greater ease, peace, and happiness. We all hope to find happiness, whether through our careers, families, or friendships. However, many of us fall into the trap of believing that once we achieve a certain goal, we will finally be satisfied. This perspective often leads to disappointment.\nHuman nature drives us to strive for more, constantly searching for the next best thing, creating an infinite loop of unsatisfied desires. For instance, many of my peers often express feelings of unhappiness and anxiety, promising themselves they will be happy once they secure an internship. However, once they achieve that milestone, the happiness they experience tends to be temporary. The cycle continues as they then strive for a full-time job, telling themselves that only then will they be content. After landing a job, the focus shifts to promotions, perpetuating the belief that happiness is always just out of reach.\nI believe that true happiness begins with a shift in mindset—one that emphasizes gratitude for the little things and everything we already have in life. Too often, we take our blessings for granted. It’s crucial to recognize that everyone is at a different point in their lives, striving for their own goals. What might seem trivial to us could be someone else’s dream. Consider the simple joys: having food to eat, a roof over our heads, or access to education. Even appreciating the pleasant weather or savoring your favorite morning coffee or tea can bring joy. Cultivating gratitude allows us to step back and appreciate the present moment.\nEven amidst challenges and hardships, a grateful mindset helps us focus on the positives and what is going well in our lives. By doing so, the difficulties we face can feel smaller and less consuming. Our brains naturally tend toward a negativity bias; we tend to remember negative experiences more vividly than positive ones. By actively practicing gratitude, we can shift our focus away from our struggles and instead embrace the positives.\nEveryone has something to be thankful for, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. We don’t need an internship, a full-time job, or a promotion to experience happiness. The fact that we are alive is reason enough to find joy in our daily lives. It’s essential to seek moments of happiness throughout our journeys instead of waiting for a specific milestone.\nMoreover, I believe that nurturing a grateful mindset can attract success. The energy we project into the world and how we present ourselves is a reflection of our mindset. For instance, imagine a company choosing between two equally qualified candidates for a job. One candidate possesses a grateful attitude, while the other does not. The grateful candidate is likely to approach the interview with positivity and cheerfulness, making a lasting impression. Companies are naturally drawn to individuals who exude positivity and enthusiasm, as these traits foster a collaborative environment.\nOur emotions are contagious; we gravitate toward those who make us feel good. By surrounding ourselves with positivity, we not only improve our own outlook but also enhance our connections and opportunities. In a way, cultivating gratitude and happiness serves as a return on investment. By investing in our mindset, we can attract greater success and fulfillment in our lives.\nUltimately, I hope that each of us realizes the power of gratitude, for the world could use a little more happiness, and that journey begins with a grateful mind."
