    "text": "Chocolate muffins and cupcakes are basically the same, aren’t they? Except cupcakes have added frosting? This has been my most repeated recipes since it’s so easy and satisfies my chocolate cravings! With 1/4 cup honey, the bitterness is comparable to 90% dark chocolate to me, so I recommend you double the sugar if you prefer sweeter. This recipe makes 12 cupcakes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Most ice creams, especially vanilla, are flavored with “natural flavors” which are not natural at all! It is nearly the same as artificial flavors, the only regulation being that it must be derived from any natural source. However, they may contain more than 100 different chemicals, including preservatives, solvents and other substances and still be called “natural flavors”. Not to mention all the added preservatives, gums, emulsifiers, and colorings in ice creams to increase the visual appeal, texture, and shelf life. I use vanilla extract in this recipe because vanilla beans are so expensive :( but if you have the means to use vanilla, I think it would work elegantly. You can also do a different flavoring or add in, ice cream is fun and flexible! Personally, my favorite combination is topping it off with olive oil and more salt. With these ingredients, I would even argue that ice cream can be a health food since full fat dairy products contain so many vitamins and minerals; honey is anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial; and eggs are arguably the most nutrient dense food ;)"
